<p>LED mirror is an interactive led installation made by Jeroen van Goor and Johan ten Broeke of Fullscreen.nl. It currently runs a few different interactive applications. For instance a loop recording app, a 'painting with highlights' app and an app displaying silhouette of spectators using a difference matte. (showcased in the video on the home page). The screen size is 122cm x 244cm and the leds have 38mm spacing. 
The design is modular and can scale up to 16 times this size and still be controlled with a single Raspberry Pi. That would make a screen size of approximately 50 square meters, wow!</p>

<p>The panel thickness is about 50mm so configurations can be integrated into walls, doors or fixed furniture elements. The horizontal spacing the of led grid can be varied to compensate for narrow viewing angles when used in architectural projects. The slim design of the led modules allows the lights to be applied on curved surfaces.</p>
<p>All hard- and software design is done by Fullscreen.nl and makes use of a Raspberry Pi with a Raspicam camera module. If you are interested in the technical details, like to read source code or build your own LED mirror. The project is on <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/led-mirror">github</a></p>
